    "Today we will be plotting and fitting a dose-response curve. The data that we will be working with are whole-cell electrophysiology recordings made from acute brain slices from rats, an example trace is shown below. We will be plotting the current responses to different concentrations of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist morphine for males versus females. The data consists of multiple experiments for each concentration. \n",
    "\n",
    "When MORs are activated they in turn activate G-protein Inwardly-Rectifying Potassium channels (GIRKs), which is what the current responses below are actually measuring. These channels allow potassium to leave the cell, and this is what creates the electrical current that we are measuring. Because there could be variable numbers of GIRK channels on a cell, the morphine current responses will be normalized to the current responses induced by a saturating concentration of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist UK, which also acts on GIRKs. Because UK is very potent, it will give us the maximum GIRK response possible. \n",
